## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

For this challenge I decided to go with css grid. I tried to use only css grid, but it wasn't so easy to do it just using css grid. So I combined css grid and flexbox to get the final result.

### Continued development

Continue to learn how to combine flexbox and css grid to create the desired layout.
