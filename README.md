## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

At first I was doing way to much calculations to horizontaly place the profile picture in the middle of the card. After doing some research I found out that this can simply be done with transform: translate(); 

### Continued development

Using flexbox and position

### Useful resources
